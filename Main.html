      <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Console Wars! Here you will learn a lot about the two
				different consoles, you will learn everything here there is to know
				about each and every console that is currently out on the market. As
				this website is new we are currently going to only look into the two
				main current consoles that are currently out right now and have the
				biggest debates over. There are currently memes out now that would
				be showing that one console is worse then the other. Please read below
				to get a comparison between the two, or click the following <a href="#xboxone">Xbox One</a>

				<h2><a id="xboxone"></a>Xbox One</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Released: November 22, 2013</li>
					<li>Developer: Microsoft</li>
					<li>Most powerful console: Xbox One X</li>
					<li>CPU: Custom 2.3 GHz AMD 8-core APU</li>
					<li>Memory:	12GB GDDR5</li>
					<li>Graphics: 1.172 GHz AMD Radeon GCN</li>
					<li>GFLOPS:6 Teraflops</li>
				</ul>
				<p> The Xbox One currently is the most powerful console to date.
					specifically the Xbox One X. This console is generating a whopping
					6 Teraflops of graphical computing power, with 12GB of GDDR5 Memory.
					The only catch with this kind of system, is that you will need to use
					games specifiaclly made or updated to support this hardware. These
					games are actualy marked as Xbox One X Enhanced. Without this the game
					will run as normal, and you may see some performance enhacements but
					nothing that will be too dramatic.</p>

			<h2><a id="ps4"></a>Playstation 4</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Released: November 15, 2013</li>
				<li>Developer: Sony</li>
				<li>Most powerful console: PS4 Pro</li>
				<li>CPU: Semi-Custom 8-core AMD x86-64 Jaguar 1.6Ghz CPU</li>
				<li>Memory:	8GB GDDR5</li>
				<li>Graphics: Semi-Custom AMD GCN Radeon</li>
				<li>GFLOPS: 4.2 Teraflops</li>
			</ul>
			<p> The PS4 Pro is not the most powerful but it is still up there. This
				console still produces 4K output in PS4 Pro Enhanced games with
				better textures that take advantage of this extra power. But if power is
				not everything for you the PS4 still has a lot of other things it can
				give you over the Xbox One. It has quite a rich selection of exclusive
				games, free online multiplayer and last but not least virtual reality.
